						<h2>Scoledge</h2>
						<h3>MAR - AUG 2015</h3>
						<p>A year ago in Paris, I met two engineers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnomine" target="_blank">Guillaume</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billyshen" target="_blank">Willy</a>, working on a student app. They needed some help on the business and design sides. As I was thrilled by the challenge and eager to develop my skills, I decided to work with them for several months. I developed their <span class="bold">marketing strategy</span> and their <span class="bold">user experience (UX)</span>. <br><br>
						<a href="https://www.scoledge.com" target="_blank">Scoldege</a> is a web&amp;mobile app that organizes the lives of students and teachers. <br><br>
						I developed a digital marketing strategy based on inbound marketing. I worked on a conversion funnel, lead by the following questions: how to attract target users (blog, social media, SEO, RP), how to convert them (landing page, CTA, forms) & how to close them (CRM, newsletter)?</p>

						<p class="text-center legend"><span class="legend">Marketing conversion funnel for Scoledge</span></p>
						<p>I also worked on the user experience (UX). I first did some user research (interviews) to better understand what teachers and students truly need/want, which helps better defining the product and key features. Then I developed some prototypes in oder to improve the user interface (UI).</p>

						<h2>hub:raum</h2>
						<h3>JULY - DEC 2014</h3>
						<p>As part of my curriculum, I worked 5 months as an Investment Analyst @ <a href="https://www.hubraum.com" target="_blank">hub:raum</a> in Berlin.</p>
						<img src="css/ressources/hubraum-chiffresEN.png" class="img-responsive ajc-img"/>
						<p> I screened more than 800 pitch decks, met more than 100 entrepreneurs and digged into Education, Healthcare, Internet of Things and SaaS spaces. This experience helped me better understand the start-ups ecosystem and the role of Venture Capital firms (VCs). <br><br> I have always been fascinated by entrepreneurs developing new products and  services trying to create some value.</p>
						<img src="css/ressources/hubraum-best.png" class="img-responsive logo-img"/>
						<p><a href="https://www.hubraum.com" target="_blank">hub:raum</a>, the incubator of Deutsche Telekom, provides seed funding for start-ups that have the potential to fundamentally transform important markets for Deutsche Telekom. Start-ups receive capital to establish market tractions as well as added benefits, such as co-working space, mentoring and introductions to Deutsche Telekom.</p>

						<h2>L'Atelier BNP Paribas</h2>
						<h3>JAN - JUN 2014</h3>
						<p>As part of my curriculum, I worked 6 months as an Project Manager @ <a href="http://www.atelier.net/en" target="_blank">L‚ÄôAtelier BNP Paribas</a> in Paris. <br><br> I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoannjaffre" target="_blank">Yoann Jaffr√©</a> on the <a href="https://lab.atelier.net/en/fintech-insurtech" target="_blank">1st BNP Paribas start-up accelerator</a> - a corporate program that helps start-ups develop their business model and grow their product in connection with BNP Paribas. This was a big challenge. On the one hand, we spent lots of time with stakeholders, both internal and external, in order to better understand their needs toward start-ups. On the other hand, we interviewed key actors from the start-up ecosystem in Paris (incubator, corporate, investors, entrepreneurs) to identify what BNP Paribas could bring to the table. Then we designed a value proposition that would suits both start-ups and BNP Paribas Business Units‚Äô needs and we presented it to the Committee. You can find more information <a href="https://lab.atelier.net/en/fintech-insurtech" target="_blank">there</a>. <br><br> I also prototyped a platform to connect start-up with the BNP Paribas Group. We acknowledged that different Business Units were interested in being introduced to start-ups products and services, but didn‚Äôt know how to do so. So we decided to create a platform that would create connections between start-ups and BNP Paribas Business Units. We first launched a MVP in order to see wether people would be interested in it. Around 200 users signed up, it was a success for us.</p>

						<p><a href="http://www.atelier.net/en" target="_blank">L‚ÄôAtelier BNP Paribas</a> is the innovation center of BNP Paribas. They develop the following activities: consulting, media, events, and open innovation. I was part of the Open Innovation Lab.</p>

						<h2>Znappit</h2>
						<h3>JUL - AUG 2013</h3>
						<p>I did my first internship at <a href="http://www.znappit.com/" target="_blank">Znappit</a> (turned <a href="http://www.soapapp.com/" target="_blank">Soap</a>), a start-up that develops a mobile video application that lets people create collaborative video for their events.</p>

						<p class="text-center legend"><span class="legend">Znappit flyer</span></p>
						<p>I was working within the 1st start-up accelerator in France: <a href="https://paris-en.numa.co/Sprint" target="_blank">Le Camping</a> (<a href="https://paris-en.numa.co/" target="_blank">Numa</a> in Paris. I learned a lot being surrounded by smart entrepreneurs trying to develop their own <a href="https://paris-en.numa.co/Startups" target="_blank">business</a>. For the first time I was experiencing Lean Start-up, Business Modeling, Product Development,  Product-market fit, etc...‚Ä®‚Ä® Znappit has been co-founded by Victor (Boss), Adrien (Designer) and Nicolas (Geek). As their first intern I worked as a swiss-army knife, doing whatever I could do to help the company grow, which means marketing and communication strategy, product development, business development but also video editing.. <br><br> I was most passionate about working on the product, trying to answer the following questions: Who is the target user? What do people want/need? How to create value? How to design an addictive experience? I learned a lot from this first experience.</p>

						<h2>Audencia Junior Conseil</h2>
						<h3>JAN - DEC 2013</h3>
						<p>As a student at Audencia Business School, I was involved in the <a href="http://www.audenciajuniorconseil.com/" target="_blank">Junior-Enterprise</a> of the school. This is a student-run association that provides companies with consulting services (Marketing, Finance, Market Research, CSR, Business Plan, etc...).</p>
						<img src="css/ressources/ajc-chiffresEN.png" class="img-responsive ajc-img"/>
						<p>I was president of the association during a year. I had to build the strategy, set the goals and implement it with the 5 departments (HR, Client Relationship, Communication, Quality and Treasureship). We managed to grow the turnover by +60% from 2012 to 2013, which was a big success for us. Above all, I learned a lot managing a 20 member team during a year.</p>
